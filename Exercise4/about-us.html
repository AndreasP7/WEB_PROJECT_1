                            This project was created by two AUEB Students in the final year of their informatics course, Andreas Papakitsos and Dimitris Vosnakis. Both driven by their high passion for computer science,
                            software and website developement, chose to create an e-commerce website to polish their coding skills.

                            The idea and its implementation took place in Athens, Greece during the winter semester of the 2023-24 academic year for the purposes of the "Website developement" course. The most 
                            visited types of site after social media are e-commerce sites. This combined with the requirements of the project, was the reason the form of the project was chosen.
